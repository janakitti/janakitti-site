The projects on this channel were created out of desire to see my video game animation ideas come to life, despite not having the technical knowledge or software to do so at the time. For example, I've used MS PowerPoint in a lot of my projects as a tool for stop-motion animation (using timed slides), an input interface (using hyperlinks), and vector art (using basic shapes). <br>Here are some of the project's I have showcased:<ul><li><b>Chromatic Squares</b>: A 7-level platformer game with on-screen controls, powerups, gravity, soundtrack, level-progress memory, and a sleek menu interface. Created entirely using 440+ slides in MS PowerPoint.</li><li><b>Paint Galaxy</b>: A cursor game where you navigate through a course while avoiding obstacles. Includes a tutorial section, 21 unique levels in 5 different worlds, and final boss with health bar. Created using MS PowerPoint.</li><li><b>Sticky Note</b>: A two-episode 'animation IRL' series that follows a character drawn on a sticky note that comes to life and interacts with the real-world environment. Created using MS PowerPoint, iMovie and Motion 5.</li><ul>",
