WizardOfColours is a YouTube channel that showcases creative projects made using minimal technical resources. The projects on this channel were motivated by a desire to bring my video game and animation ideas to life at a time when I didn't have quite enough technical knowledge or access to professional software. Here are some of the project's I have showcased:<ul><li><b>Chromatic Squares</b>: A 7-level platformer game with on-screen controls, powerups, gravity, soundtrack, level-progress memory, and a sleek menu interface. Created entirely using 440+ slides in MS PowerPoint.</li><li><b>Paint Galaxy</b>: A cursor game where you navigate through a course while avoiding obstacles. Includes a tutorial section, 21 unique levels in 5 different worlds, and final boss with health bar. Created using MS PowerPoint.</li><li><b>Sticky Note</b>: A two-episode ‘animation IRL’ series that follows a character drawn on a sticky note that comes to life and interacts with the real-world environment. Created using MS PowerPoint, iMovie and Motion 5.</li><ul>
